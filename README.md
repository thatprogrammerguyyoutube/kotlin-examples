# Kotlin Example

This repository holds the kotlin example code for my different [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/@thatprogrammerguy/featured).

This repository used [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) for the build system.

The easiest way to get setup is to download the project as a zip file, extract it, and then open the extracted folder using [IntelliJ Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).
